You can use this skill to control your TiVo with your Amazon Echo and Alexa voice control.\n\nAll of the voice commands start with 'Alexa, tell/ask TiVo to ...':\n\nCONTROL\n... change/go to channel <channel number>\n... force channel <channel number> (cancels recording if necessary)\n... pause\n... play\n... fast forward\n... replay\n... skip/advance ahead (30 second skip)\n... skip commercials (for SkipMode-enabled recordings)\n... record this show (requires manual confirmation)\n\nFEATURES\n... turn on/off captions\n... turn on/off/toggle QuickMode\n\nPLACES\n... go to Live TV\n... go Home/TiVo Central\n... go to/show My Shows/Now Playing\n... go to/show To Do List\n\nPROVIDERS\n... launch <provider name>\n\nCurrently supported providers are:\n\n- HBO Go\n- Amazon\n- Netflix\n- Hulu\n- YouTube\n- MLB.TV\n- Plex\n- VUDU\n- HSN\n- FlixFling\n- ToonGoggles\n- WWE\n- Yahoo\n- YuppTV\n- Pandora\n- Spotify\n- iHeartRadio\n\nYou must update your config.json file in the TiVo Control directory and mark the providers you have active on your TiVo as 'true'. This is used by the program to dynamically determine the remote key-presses required to navigate to the proper menu item.\n\nADVANCED\n... send the command <command>\n\n<command> can be any command defined in the TiVo TCP Remote Protocol. For example:\n- KEYBOARD commands (letters, numbers, etc.)\n- IRCODE commands (thumbs up/down, navigation (up, down, left, right), etc.)\n\nSending individual commands to the TiVo with Alexa can be cumbersome since each command needs to be issued separately (i.e., 'Alexa, tell TiVo to send the command down', 'Alexa, tell TiVo to send the command select'). For complex interactions, using the physical remote control is the better method.\n\nOTHER\n... for Help: add this card to your Alexa app\n",
